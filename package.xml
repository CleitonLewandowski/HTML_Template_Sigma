  <summary>An implementation of Integrated Templates API with template 'compilation' added</summary>
  <description>
HTML_Template_Sigma implements Integrated Templates API designed by Ulf Wendel.

Features:
* Nested blocks. Nesting is controlled by the engine.
* Ability to include files from within template: &amp;lt;!-- INCLUDE --&amp;gt;
* Automatic removal of empty blocks and unknown variables (methods to manually tweak/override this are also available)
* Methods for runtime addition and replacement of blocks in templates
* Ability to insert simple function calls into templates: func_uppercase('Hello world!') and to define callback functions for these
* 'Compiled' templates: the engine has to parse a template file using regular expressions to find all the blocks and variable placeholders. This is a very &quot;expensive&quot; operation and is an overkill to do on every page request: templates seldom change on production websites. Thus this feature: an internal representation of the template structure is saved into a file and this file gets loaded instead of the source one on subsequent requests (unless the source changes)
* PHPUnit-based tests to define correct behaviour
* Usage examples for most of the features are available, look in the docs/ directory

    <notes>
* Added getBlockList() and getPlaceholderList() methods (thanks to Markus Wolff for the idea).
* HTML_Template_IT compatibility: get() does not clear the parsed block contents by default.
* Removed obsolete docs, current ones are in the PEAR manual.

      <notes>
This release has Sigma's template functions/callbacks infrastructure significantly enhanced.
This unfortunately means some backwards compatibility breaks. If you were using callbacks before, please carefully examine the release notes and test you scripts before upgrading to 1.0.
If you weren't using callbacks due to their shortcomings it is a good time to give them a try, consult docs/example_4.php for some of their possible applications.

Template functions/callbacks changes and incompatibilities:

* Templates are parsed for function calls not only on setTemplate()/loadTemplatefile(), but on addBlock()/addBlockfile() and replaceBlock()/replaceBlockfile() as well.
* The arguments to template functions can now contain variable placeholders: func_uppercase('Hello, {username}!).
* Template functions are now compatible with template caching.
* Method setCallbackFunction() now accepts a callback that is compatible with call_user_func() as its second argument. Its third argument is used to control variable substitution in function arguments.
* Method performCallback() was removed. Callbacks are now called automatically when the block containing them is parse()'d.
* Callbacks are now called via call_user_func_array() instead of call_user_func(). This makes it possible to use built-in functions as callbacks, but also means that you have to rewrite your old functions!
* Usage example is available in docs/example_4.php

Other changes:

* Option 'use_preg' was removed.
* Stricter error checking when doing addBlockfile() with a prepared template.

      <version>0.9.2</version>
      <state>stable</state>
      <date>2003-04-21</date>
      <notes>
* Added usage examples
* Added the cache FAQ
* This is the last 0.9.x release unless some bugs are found. The 1.0 release will 
  have callbacks significantly redone and will require changes to your scripts if
  you use callbacks.

  Thanks to Maxim Panasiuk for the report.
